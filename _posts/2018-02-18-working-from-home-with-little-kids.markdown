title: Working from home, with little kids in the house
description: > 
  I very much prefer working from home to working from an
  office. But with little kids in the house, that’s a nontrivial
  endeavor.

I’ve worked exclusively from home[^1] for the last 6½ years, and
when I first started, my older kids were 7 and 6 years old. For the
last 3 years after the arrival of our two younger children, though,
I’ve worked from home **with infants/toddlers in the house,** and
that’s a wholly different ball game.

## The basic rules of working from home

If you’ve dealt with the idea of working from home, or have
done it before, then you’re surely familiar with a few basic rules to
follow:

* Make sure that you have a _home office,_ that is a working space to
  yourself that allows you to close a door and be undisturbed when you
  need it.

* Set aside some time to go outside. Office workers have a commute
  that ensures they get out of the house; as a home worker you’re
  running a certain risk of turning into a hermit. Make sure you run
  errands, take walks, go for runs.

* Keep tabs on your working hours. Home workers are frequently at risk
  of working too much or too long, which puts a strain on yourself,
  your significant other, and your family.

* Maintain relationships with others who work from home. Chat with
  them, call them, invite them over for dinner if they live close
  by. Working from home is still not a common thing to do in general
  (however common it might be in the tech industry), so exchanging
  thoughts with people in the same boat is a good thing.

* Be ready to try out working-from-home strategies that have worked
  for others. Fortunately for all of us, there are quite a few people
  who talk about the experience publicly — for example,
  [John Dalton](https://twitter.com/johndalton) did so in a
  [45-minute talk](https://youtu.be/qFWkDPTjjEM) at linux.conf.au
  2018.

## Now, the challenging part: *little* kids

If anyone reading this wants to pre-emptively freak out and berate me
for being an irresponsible or unloving parent, you are politely asked
to chill and if incapable of doing so, to GTFO. I absolutely love
being around my children, and I wouldn’t even _think_ to trade my job
for an office-dwelling one. Being able to work from home is generally
a wonderful privilege, and so is being around my kids.

You need to be aware of two things: one, working from home with a
family is different from working from home when you’re alone or living
with an adult partner or roomie. Two, working from home with a family
with little children is _very_ different from a family with school-age
kids. School-age children don’t permanently need an adult in the room,
they spend a significant amount of their time outside the house,
they’re usually not particularly prone to tantrums, and in the event
that you really, really need some quiet, they can be asked to give you
that for a limited amount of time. Kids under two?  Good luck with
that.

If you’re not striking a balance here, here’s what’s likely to
happen: you’ll think that you are a completely inadequate parent, or a
terrible employee, or both. So, never lose sight of the fact that
you’re probably a wonderful parent and a highly productive employee —
but that you can do _anything,_ but not _everything._[^2]

My most important piece of advice here is that you **should not attempt
to _simultaneously_ be a primary parent and an employee.** (Please
note the emphasis on “simultaneously.”)

I think it’s fundamentally impossible to be a mindful parent of your
kids, and *at the same time* a productive knowledge worker. And the
repeated attempt will lead to frustration and burnout. Of course, you
can split your day in half with your significant other, if for example
you happen to be a night owl and they are not, and you can put in a
full day of work between 1pm and 9pm (but do ensure you get enough
sleep, which is probably a topic for another post). Or you could rise
early and start working at 6 while your other half drops your kids off
at daycare, from whence you pick them up at 2. But whatever it is that
you decide, please don’t fool yourself into thinking that you can work
productively, and be a good parent for your kids at the very same
time.

## Productivity tips during work hours

So, we’ve established that work time and parenting time shouldn’t
overlap. So what can you do while you’re at work, and your kids are in
the house (under the supervision of your spouse or partner, or other
trusted guardian)? Spoiler: “please, kids, be quiet for a bit” isn’t
going to work. Not with toddlers. And sound-proofing your room is
quite expensive, and also remarkably ineffective for the deep bass
_whooomp_ of an exuberant kid jumping off a couch upstairs.

* I find myself being able to focus extremely well if I **play
[pink noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_noise) through my
headphones.**[^3] It drowns out practically all background noise, and
is uniform enough that my brain eventually drops it as an input, and I
barely notice it.

* I also habitually **close my door** when I need to work. Obviously, my
family knows that they can call on me when something urgent comes up,
but little kids rightfully take an open door as an invitation. And as
much as I would like to be able to tolerate interruptions of my
thinking flow to play with a little one for a few minutes, and then
immediately pick up where I left off,
[I am not.](http://heeris.id.au/2013/this-is-why-you-shouldnt-interrupt-a-programmer/)[^4]
So, this is a classic trade-off: I can either enjoy the interaction
with my kids and then deal with the frustration that comes with not
getting things done, or I can get things done and regret that I didn’t
spend more time with my kids. There’s no right answer. The wrong
answer that I choose is that my door stays closed.

## Striking a balance (or trying to)

There are a few things I do to try and balance my in-house family
absence (I’m dead serious, that’s what working from home is):

* When I’m home, **I don’t miss lunch.**[^5] I can’t say that I’ve _never_
  missed lunch because I have done so when a customer’s or colleague’s
  environment had just reached the
  [HCF instruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halt_and_Catch_Fire),
  but I won’t miss lunch for a meeting that can also be scheduled to
  an hour earlier or later.

* Also, **tucking the little ones in** is my job every night.

* **I don’t travel when it would mean being absent for a child’s
  birthday.** Which is actually not that easy to do when you’re on the
  conference circuit, travel about 100 days per year, and you have a
  big family — thus far, if my math is right I’ve successfully
  navigated 28 kids’ birthdays.[^6]


## Am I succeeding?

Let’s be real: **I have no way of knowing.** Whether I’m being a
decent parent will ultimately be judged by my children when they’ve
grown up. Whether I’ve had a successful career is something I’ll
decide upon my retirement.

But hey, such is life. And thus far it looks like I don’t
suck at it. I hope. :smiley:

[^1]: Well, not *just* from home. Throughout the last few years I’ve
    traveled rather extensively, so I’ve also worked from planes,
    airport lounges, trains, hotel rooms, customer offices, cafes and
    parks. What I mean is that I haven’t had to go to an office on a
    daily basis, since 2011. 

[^2]: Hat tip to
    [David Allen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Allen_(author)),
    whose [Getting Things Done](http://a.co/iZhglcP) is not the
    ultimate fount of all self-management wisdom, but definitely a
    good source to have read at least once.

[^3]: On a Linux box with [SoX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoX),
    you can generate an Ogg Vorbis file containing 25 minutes of pink
    noise with
	```
	sox -n pinknoise.ogg synth 25:00 pinknoise
	```
	— the 25-minute length may come in handy if you’re using
    [Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). As
    with music, I play my pink noise from
    [Audacious](https://audacious-media-player.org/) with the
    [MPRIS](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/mpris-spec/latest/)-2
    plugin enabled, which allows me to pause and play from
    [gnome-shell](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeShell) with the
    [Media Player Indicator](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/55/media-player-indicator/)
    extension.

[^4]: I do not consider myself a programmer. But the issue described
    in the cartoon applies to any knowledge worker. In fact, it
    probably applies to _any_ worker, it’s just that I’ve been doing
    knowledge work for the entirety of my career, and can’t comment
    authoritatively on anything else.

[^5]: For those of you who grew up outside central Europe: over here,
    lunch (not dinner) is traditionally considered the “big” meal of
    the day.

[^6]: I also took uninterrupted travel breaks of 6 and 10 weeks,
    respectively, when our younger kids were born. (When the older
    ones arrived, I was traveling way less overall, so those travel
    schedule adjustments were easy at the time.)
