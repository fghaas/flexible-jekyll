It’s been a while since I maintained a blog that wasn’t primarily
centered on things directly related to work. So I’m starting this
thing here.

You can still find my prior work blog
[on the hastexo web site](https://www.hastexo.com/author/florian.html),
the _even older_ (and by now woefully outdated) one at
[wordpress.com](https://fghaas.wordpress.com/), and in the future
there will likely be some blog posts on the
[City Cloud blog](https://www.citycloud.com/blog/).

For those of you interested in the technical details, this blog uses
[GitHub Pages built with Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/). The
Jekyll theme is
[Flexible-Jekyll](https://github.com/artemsheludko/flexible-jekyll) by
[Artem Sheludko](https://github.com/artemsheludko).
