It’s been a while since I maintained a blog that wasn’t primarily
centered on specific, work-related technical issues. So I’m starting
this thing here.

You can still find my prior work blog
[on the hastexo web site](https://www.hastexo.com/author/florian.html),
the _even older_ (and by now woefully outdated) one at
[wordpress.com](https://fghaas.wordpress.com/), and in the future
there will likely be some blog posts on the
[City Cloud blog](https://www.citycloud.com/blog/).

To be abundantly clear, none of what I write here is in any way
endorsed by any company I am affiliated with. I don’t yet know whether
this is going to go into any particular topical direction, hence the
“fairly random ramblings” tagline. Chances are some of it is going to
be about work, other bits not so much. We’ll see.

For those of you interested in technical details, this blog uses
[GitHub Pages built with Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/). An
Atom feed is [here](/feed.xml). The Jekyll theme is
[Flexible-Jekyll](https://github.com/artemsheludko/flexible-jekyll) by
[Artem Sheludko](https://github.com/artemsheludko). Fonts are
[Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) for headings and
[Cantarell](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cantarell) for body
text.
