  Dos and Don’ts in Professional Services (for freelancers and small teams)
description: >
  So you’re a freelance tech person or developer, or you provide
  professional services as part of a small firm. I’ve done that for
  several years and have a few recommendations for you.

This was originally I talk I proposed to
[linux.conf.au](https://linux.conf.au) this year. It didn’t get
accepted (another one got in though! I’m not complaining), so I put it
into this article instead.

Between 2011 and 2017, I ran a tiny consulting team. That team and I
are now part of a larger organization, but for those of you who are in
the same boat that I was in, or are flying solo altogether, I think I
have a few useful recommendations.

## A few words up front

Whether you’re just getting started or have worked for some time as a
consultant, technology educator or developer, you should understand
that you have a right to be treated as a professional — if, and this
is important, you act like one. And yes, a lot of whether you’re being
perceived as acting professionally or not is in the first impression
people get of you and your work. So here are a few suggestions that
have a direct impact on exactly that.

## Things you should do

### Have a web site.

Seriously now. If you’re freelancing as a consultant or developer, you
can put together a web site. Use
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) like I do for this blog. Or
get hosting for cheap, and use a static web site generator like
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) or
[Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/). Or get cheap
[WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) hosting, whatever. You could even
use [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/) if you’re feeling
hipster or have been listening to too many podcasts. But have a web
presence to explain the services you offer, and what they cost, and
also as a central repository for customer testimonials.


### Post a PSA and get your customers to sign it.

Have a professional services agreement that outlines the conditions
under which you offer your services, a disclaimer of warranty and
limitation of liability, your defition of billable time, a
non-disclosure policy, your payment terms, and a force majeure
clause. There are many
[template PSAs](https://www.google.com/search?q=Professional+Services+Agreement)
floating around on the web.

Ideally, make your PSA a click-to-accept precondition for buying any
services off you. If you can’t do that with your web site, use an
online signing service. 

### Post your rates.

There a few things I can think of that are dumber than keeping your
rates a secret. Your potential customers have a right to know what
you’re worth. And quite frankly, it’s damn unprofessional to offer a
product or service without a price. If
[SpaceX can post rates for hauling stuff into orbit](http://www.spacex.com/about/capabilities),
you can post a rate for an hour of your time.

### Post a discount policy.

There are several reasonable things that you can offer discounts for:

* Bulk. If you post an hourly rate and a customer wants to hire you
  for 100 hours, it’s OK to give them a discounted rate — _if they pay
  upfront._
* Educational and charitable organizations. Does your customer serve
  the public good? You can offer a discount for that — _if you wish to
  support their cause._
* A case study. If the customer’s case is interesting and would make
  for a good testimonial, that’s another thing you might offer — _if
  they give you a commitment, in writing, along with placing a
  purchase order._

### Send quotes.

Every customer deserves to get a price quote. Your price quote should
contain:

* A title identifying it clearly as a price quote. Hint: the words
  _Price Quote,_ in title case, work quite nicely.
* An identifying number.
* A date, and an expiry. Having your quote expire after 10 or 15 days
  is perfectly reasonable.
* Your customer’s name and address.
* A reference to your PSA.
* The services. If your work is specified in a detailed Statement of
  Work (itself a good idea to prepare), insert the line “Services as
  specified in [name of SoW], [date of SoW]”.
* Your price.
* Payment terms.

### Make it easy to get paid.

Particularly when you’re dealing with the bureaucracy of a large
customer, you will have to follow up on invoices and chase down
payments. This normally isn’t due to incompetence or ill will on your
customer’s end — rather, they will deal with dozens or hundreds of
invoices to process every day, and it just might happen that yours
takes some time to process.

So, make sure that the people on the customer end whose job it is to
approve and release your payment find that an easy thing to do. Among
other things, here are a few things you should do:

* Send an invoice at the earliest possible time. Depending on your
  quote and payment terms, this may be upfront, or when your services
  are completed, or at some agreed-upon milestone.
* Reference the customer’s PO number on every invoice. Many
  organizations have internal rules that explicitly forbid processing
  an invoice that does not reference a PO. (This, by the way, is one
  of the reasons why you should never commence delivery of your
  services before you have received a PO —
  [more on that below](#dont-work-without-a-purchase-order).)
* Put a reminder on your calendar when the invoice is due, and if you
  haven’t been paid by that date, send a payment reminder _the very
  next day._ Many payment delays are due to accounting departments
  simply being overloaded; a friendly reminder that an invoice is past
  due is entirely appropriate.
* If you are working internationally, enable customers to pay you in
  their currency. In particular, if you’re dealing with customers in
  the United States, be prepared to deal with a person who practically
  never deals in any currency other than U.S. dollars, and to whom the
  concept of foreign currencies is complex beyond imagination.

There’s one particularly painful issue specific to U.S. customers if
you happen to be based in Europe, and that’s when they insist on
paying by check.[^1] In many European countries, banks will simply
refuse to cash checks made out in U.S. dollars because of widespread
fraud. My suggestion for dealing with such customers is to notify them
upfront (that is, with your initial quote, or even better on your web
site) that you cannot under any circumstances accept payment by check,
and that you insist on payment by international money order using a
[BIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9362) and
[IBAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bank_Account_Number). If
that’s a no-go for them, politely refuse their business.
